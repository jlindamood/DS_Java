1. shortjob, quickjob, littlejob, mediumproc, longproc.

2. You want to do the shortest time first.

Take the case of a 10 second to completion task, 20 second, and 30.
If you did longest to shortest, turn around would be:
30 + 50 + 60, or 140 seconds.
With shortest to longest:
10 + 30 + 60, or 100 seconds.
